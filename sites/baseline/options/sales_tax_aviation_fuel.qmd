## Sales tax on aviation fuel

## New Jersey

This is all from secondaryÂ sources so I have not confirmed beyond a shadow of a doubt:

-   (As of Dec 2018): Under current law, airlines do not pay a fuel tax on interstate and foreign flights, aside from the amount of **fuel used in \"burnout,\" which occurs during taxiing and takeoff**. The new legislation would require airlines to pay \$0.04 per gallon on fuel purchased in New Jersey, unless the airlines are operating at an airport in the state which sees less than 20,000 commercial flights a year (that\'s every airport except Newark). [nj.com](https://www.nj.com/news/2018/12/nj-dems-want-to-raise-tax-on-jet-fuel-to-fund-path-but-airlines-hope-the-idea-crashes-and-burns.html){style="font-size: 13pt;"}

-   Prior to approx late 2018, NJ sales and excise taxes on airline fuel were based on "burnoff" \-- fuel used in taxing and takeoff (and possibly also to landing, and flight in airspace, according to one article), rather than all fuel purchased in NJ

-   Late 2018 several legislators proposed [extending the taxes to all purchases in NJ](https://skift.com/2018/09/25/new-jersey-lawmakers-threaten-united-with-new-fuel-tax-at-newark-airport/) and using for a PATH project - probably because [FAA rules now require airline fees to be used for related projects](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2015/2/21/faa-limits-use-of-states-aviation-fuel-taxes). As originally drafted, the bill only applied to United.

-   As far as I can tell, in early 2019 it was [passed](https://njbiz.com/nj-assembly-approves-united-airlines-jet-fuel-tax-hike/) and presumably enacted, but applied to [all airlines](https://liveandletsfly.com/new-jersey-airport-fuel-tax/) it appears.

-   I looked for, and believe, it has not been repealed. But haven't fully investigated. So I think the current treatment is all aviation fuel w/b taxed.

-   Obviously the Port Authority would have a dog in this fight, and you'd probably have to give the revenue to them, and get something else in return.
