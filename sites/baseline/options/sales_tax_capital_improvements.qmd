## Sales tax on capital improvement installation services

See [this](https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/understanding-sales-tax-rules-for-the-construction-industry).

-   In the majority of states (NY is one of these):

    -   Supplies and materials purchased by contractors are taxable. Some exceptions depending on type of contract and type of customer.

    -   Their related services of installation and construction are exempt.Â 

-   About 14 states treat construction contractors like resellers: their purchases are exempt, but gross sales to the customer (including materials as well as service) are taxable. More often done for itemized contracts than lump sum.

[NYS](https://www.tax.ny.gov/pubs_and_bulls/tg_bulletins/st/capital_improvements.htm):

-   Capital improvement services are exempt; repair and maintenance services are taxable. (CI: adds value, affixed, permanent; RM: intended to keep property in good working order)

-   Materials etc. purchased for capital improvements are taxable regardless of who purchases

-   Contractor should get exemption certificate from customer and not collect sales tax for the project (since taxes already paid on materials, and services are exempt)
