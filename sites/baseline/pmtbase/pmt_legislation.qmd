# Impact of 2011 Payroll Mobility Tax Legislation

## Legislative history

-   Note: You can obtain text of chapter laws at a website of the Legislative Bill Drafting Commission [@legislativebilldraftingcommissionNewYorkLegislative].
-   Chapter 25 of the Laws of 2009 added Article 23 to the Tax Law which establishes the metropolitan commuter transportation mobility tax (MCTMT). The wage tax was generally effective March 1, 2009 (September 1, 2009 for public school districts) and the self-employment tax was effective for tax years beginning in 2009. (See Part C section 23 of the chapter for effective dates.)
-   Here are key provisions from the act [@Chapter25Laws2009], in new sections 800-803 of the Tax Law (I have not copied below some of the administrative provisions). You can find a good summary in the Tax Department's Technical Services Bulletin Memorandum [@CorrectionTSBM09MCTMT2009]. Note that (1) there was a de minimis employer threshold for taxation (\$2,500 in a quarter), (2) federal, interstate, and similar employers were exempt, but there was no exemption for school districts (however, see next bullet), (3) the tax rate was a flat 0.034% for all, and (4) self-employed individuals with net self-employment earnings below \$10,000 are excluded from paying tax.

-   Chapter 25 of the Laws of 2009 also added a provision to the Education Law in Part D stating that public school districts would be reimbursed for payment of the tax via payments from the state (to the extent appropriated).

-   Chapter 56 of the Laws of 2011 [@Chapter56Laws2011] made significant changes. Here are the strikeouts and additions of the substantive provisions of the tax, from the chapter law. There also were changes to employer filing requirements elsewhere in the chapter law that appear inconsequential from a revenue perspective and I don't include them below. A good summary of the 2011 changes, including the filing-requirement changes, is the Tax Department's Technical Services Bulletin Memorandum [@LegislativeAmendmentsMetropolitan2012].

![](images/paste-ED72C33A.png)

-   Education Law section 3609-g does not appear to have been repealed by Chapter 56 of the Laws of 2011, or by subsequent laws. (The Senate website of current laws shows it [still in effect](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/EDN/3609-G).) However, it would not be necessary to repeal it: keeping it in effect would allow the state to make any lingering refund payments outstanding after the tax on school districts was repealed, and if there are any taxpayers who still must pay the tax up front but then apply for refunds, the mechanism would still work. (I have not examined the law carefully to see if there are any such situations.)
-   I summarize the changes, other than the filing-requirement changes, in the table below:

## The PMT revenue offset

-   This information is from [@metropolitantransportationauthority2022CombinedContinuing2022, pp.27+]. In most years before 2017, the annual PMT Revenue Offset was approximately \$309 million. The 2017-18 state budget lowered the appropriation to \$244.3 million for MTA's 2017 fiscal year and later. Here's the history and 2022 projection (p.28); 2020 and 2021 average to \$244 million, which suggests that the strange year to year changes were related to NYS or MTA cash flow objectives:

## What happened to PMT revenue after the 2011 legislation went into effect?

NOTE: The discussion below treats the federal exemption as being added in 2011, but in fact it existed prior.

pmtbase <- readRDS(here::here("data", "pmtbase.rds"))

tib <-  pmtdf |>
  filter(year(date)>=2010, local_mtapmt != 0) |> 
  select(date, local_mtapmt, local_mtapmtpitnet, totpmt)|> 
  mutate(date=yearmonth(date)) |> 
  as_tsibble(index=date)

```

We'd expect to start seeing impacts beginning April or May of 2012. The changes are large enough that we should be able to see some effect in simple plots.

One crude but useful way to look at this is to examine year over year % change before and after the legislation went into effect. This is worth doing because it helps to remove some of the impact of wage growth (if year over year wage growth before and after the change were similar, then a lot of the pre- and post- difference in growth rates might be related to the legislation).

The figure below, based on data from [@newyorkstatedepartmentoftaxationandfinanceNewYorkState2022], shows growth before and after the tax change and suggests that the growth rate fell off substantially during the 12 months in which collections under the reduced tax are compared to collections under the prior tax (ie., between the two green lines). Eyeballing it suggests that the reduction in the growth rate could be on the order of 15-20%. It's hard to be sure because underlying growth in wages could have changed substantially in this period. During this period the tax was raising about \$1.2-1.4 billion so the reduction was significant. It does not look to me like it would have exceeded the \$309 million offset in place at the time.

In a later iteration of this document I'll use a regression approach that takes wage growth into account, that comes up with specific estimates, and that projects forward to the current level of tax (\$1.6-1.7 billion).

## What economic data suggest about the size of the 2011 tax reduction

*Note: The discussion below treats the federal employers exclusion as part of the 2011 legislation. However, the review of legislation above shows that the federal employers exclusion was in effect before 2011. Thus, the estimates below slightly overstate the 2011 impact, all else equal. I'll update the numbers when time permits.*

I have not finished an analysis of the 2011 tax reduction based on economic data. However, I reprise below the prior table showing the crosswalk from a simple construction of the tax base based on BEA data, to one that removes several effects we have discussed.

```{r}

tab <- readRDS(here::here("sites", "baseline", "pmtbase", "pmt_revloss_tab.rds"))
tab

#   #| output: true

```

We can take this a bit further, simply (until I have time for a better calculation), as follows:

-   The tax base as a percentage of BEA earnings is approximately 69.9% of BEA earnings, including the reduction for small employers.

-   Thus, if BEA earnings were \$100, then the base would be \$70. But this includes the impact of the reduction for small employers of 7.5%, or about \$7.50.

-   Thus, if the pre-tax-reduction base was \$77.50 and the small employer reduction was \$7.50, that part of the 2011 legislation was approximately 9.7% of the pre-reduction base.

-   That doesn't reflect the impact of the tax reduction for the next-larger group of employers. My back-of-the-envelope guess for this (to be refined) based on SUSB data is that this rate reduction is no more than a quarter as large as the small-employer base reduction.

-   Wages in the next-higher employer group of 20-99 employees, which more than spans the income for the low tax rate thresholds, is about the same as for the smallest-group that is excluded from the tax. If even half of these wages were taxed at a lower rate - which seems high - and if that rate is approximately half of the full rate, then the reduction would be about 2.4% of the pre-reduction tax base (9.7% x 1/2 x 1/2).

-   The combined impact would be on the order of 9.7% (base reduction) + 2.4% (rate reduction), or 12.1% of the pre-reduction base. If we use \$1.7 billion as the current amount of the tax, then pre-reduction would be \$1,700m / 0.879 = \$1,934 million, and the reduction would be about \$234 million.

-   That glosses over a lot of details but I think it's in the right ballpartk.

## Considering the two approaches together

Considering both approaches to the issue, my rough guess is that the reduction was on the order of 10-15% of the prior base, although it's possible to get a more-serious estimate.

If the current tax is \$1,700 million, and the tax cut was 15%, the pre-cut base would be \$2,000 million (1,700 / .85), and the cut would be \$300 million. This exceeds the current offset of \$244 million, of course.
