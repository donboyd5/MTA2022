# Payroll Mobility Tax Base: Economic Data and Actual Revenue

## Question

-   According to the MTA, BLS data on earnings in the transportation district suggest, at a rate of 34 basis points, revenue of about \$2.8 billion in 2020. Actual revenue was much lower. (Collections in 2020 appear to be \$1.56 billion.)

-   What accounts for the difference?

## Short answer

-   The BEA data used by MTA include items not taxed under the PMT:

    1.  wage supplements (e.g., contributions to Social Security and pension funds),

    2.  estimates by BEA of unreported proprietors' income,

    3.  wages paid by K-12 schools,

    4.  wages paid by federal agencies,

    5.  wages paid by very small employers below the tax threshold, and

    6.  self-employment income of very small businesses below the tax threshold.

-   In addition, the PMT has lower rates for small employers who are large enough to pay tax.

-   Adjusting for items 1-4 above, reduces the PMT estimate from \$2.8 billion to \$2.1 billion. (This does not adjust for the small-employer and small-business threshold or the small-employer low rates.)

-   The biggest impact comes from removing wage supplements, followed by much smaller impacts from removing unreported proprietors' income and wages paid by K-12 schools. The impact of removing federal agency wages is minimal.

-   This is still a big difference from actual collections: The adjusted BEA earnings data suggest revenue of about \$2.1 billion in 2020 vs. collections of about \$1.56 billion -- \$500 million, so the estimate is 30+% greater than actual collections.

-   About 2/3 of the overestimate is due to an overestimate of the tax on employer wages, and the other 1/3 is an overestimate of the tax on self-employment income.

-   What could account for the remaining overestimate?

    -   Small employer and small business thresholds? I tentatively think this could be a sizable part of the overestimate. I looked at data from [Statistics of U.S. Businesses (SUSB)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/susb/about.html) for [2019](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2019/econ/susb/2019-susb-annual.html) (latest available) for [Metropolitan Statistical Areas](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/susb/tables/2019/msa_3digitnaics_2019.xlsx). I looked at the New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA Metro Area. The payroll of employers with fewer than 20 employees (many of which would be exempt from the PMT due to the size threshold) was 12.5 percent of total payroll in the metro area. So this could be significant part of the overestimate. It is possible to use the SUSB data to analyze this more carefully by using county-level data (constructing an estimate for the MTA region) and examining employer size more carefully.

    -   Low rates for small employers? The SUSB data could be helpful here. My rough guess based on a simple look at the data suggests that the impact of the low rate might be about half as large as the impact of the small employer threshold so this, too, might not be trivial.

    -   Other unaccounted-for differences between the legal tax base and economic data? I suspect this accounts for some of the difference, although I would need to talk to the Department of Taxation and Finance to understand likely differences.

    -   Tax evasion? This could be part of the difference, as it is with any tax. Wages are not as easy to hide as self-employment income so the latter seems a more likely contributor to me.

-   What should we do to learn more? This may be enough information for you. But if you want more in-depth analysis, I think the steps would be:

    -   First, I should do more-serious estimates of the impact of the small employer and small business thresholds, and the low rates for small employers.

    -   Second, I should talk to the NYS Tax Department to compare notes and learn what they know about differences between the legal tax base and economic data.

-   If you want me to do this please let me know.

## The MTA analysis

-   MTA used data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), from table *CAINC5N Personal Income by Major Component and Earnings by NAICS Industry*, which can be found [here](https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=70&step=1#tabpanel_1_6).
-   Here is a table from the MTA analysis. It shows \$815.8 billion of 2020 earnings in the MTA region which, at a 0.34% rate, would yield \$2.8 billion in PMT revenue (if fully taxed). By contrast, PMT tax receipts in 2020 were \$1.56 billion.[@metropolitantransportationauthority2022CombinedContinuing2022]

## Why the difference (why do BEA earnings overstate the tax base and tax revenue)?

### The PMT tax base

Recall that the MTA tax is based on wages plus self-employment income from activity in the MTA region, with certain exclusions and exemptions.

-   Definition of the wage base of the PMT:

    -   According to [@metropolitantransportationauthority2022CombinedContinuing2022] p.139, "Payroll expenses subject to the PMT includes all wages or compensation (as defined under sections 3121 or 3231 of the Internal Revenue Code), including back pay, sick pay, **deferred compensation**, and bonuses if the payroll payment is attributable to services performed while the employee is or was a covered employee...for most employers, payroll expense is the amount of the employee wages or other compensation that is subject to the Medicare portion of the federal social security taxes".

    -   The "deferred compensation" term raises the question of whether SOME wage supplements are in fact included in the base.

    -   Based on what [appears to be a reliable source](https://news.bloombergtax.com/payroll/payroll-in-practice-1-3-2022) \[subject to verification\], "A 401(k) plan is a qualified retirement plan that allows for **employer** contributions that are **exempt** from Social Security and Medicare taxes and tax-deferred for income tax. In addition, a 401(k) plan provides for **employee** contributions on a salary-reduction basis that are tax-deferred for income tax purposes, but **taxable** for Social Security and Medicare taxes."

    -   Thus, wage supplements paid by the **employer** (those included in the BEA definition of wage supplements) appear to be exempt from the PMT.

### BEA definitions

BEA "earnings" include wages plus certain non-wage income so at first blush BEA may appear to measure something akin to the tax base, but there are important differences.

The main issues, discussed in more detail below are:

-   BEA non-wage earnings include employer contributions to retirement systems (paid for the benefit of employees), which are not part of the PMT base. I estimate that this was about 15.2% of earnings in 2020.

-   BEA proprietors' income, a component of non-wage earnings, is much larger than the analogous IRS concept self-employment income because BEA includes estimated amounts for underreporting. I estimate that this was 3.4% of earnings in 2020.

-   BEA wages include wages paid by public school districts, which are not included in the PMT tax base. I estimate that this was 3.1% of earnings in 2020.

-   BEA wages include wages paid by the federal government an related entities, which also are not in the PMT tax base. I estimate that this was 0.9% of earnings in 2020.

The combination of these effects is to reduce earnings by 22.6% - that is, after these reductions the PMT base appears to be about 77.4% of BEA earnings in 2020.

## Net impact

### Estimated impact on PMT tax base

The combination of these effects is to reduce earnings by 22.6% in 2020 - that is, after these reductions the PMT base appears to be about 77.4% of BEA earnings in 2020. The adjustments have been stable over recent years as the table below shows.

```

Several additional factors not considered above also reduce PMT revenue

-   Wages paid by small employers (those with annual wages less than about \$1.2 million) are excluded from the tax base but are included in the MTA calculation.

-   Very small employers (generally with annual wages less than about \$1.2 million) are exempt from the tax.

-   Small employers (generally with annual wages of \$1.2 million to \$1.7 million pay graduated tax rates that are below the full statutory rate of 0.34%.

-   As with all taxes, there is no doubt some avoidance and evasion further reducing revenue.

### Impact on estimated PMT revenue

The following table shows BEA earnings, the estimated PMT tax base after the adjustments above, and estimated tax revenue at 0.34%, by county, in 2020. The adjustments have different impacts across counties - for example, they reduce the estimated PMT tax by 34.7% in the Bronx but only by 16.6% in Manhattan.

## Implications

** CAUTION: I HAVE NOT YET UPDATED NUMBERS IN THE TEXT BELOW TO REFLECT THE SMALL-EMPLOYER EXCLUSION, WHICH NOW IS INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE **

The approach above makes better use of BEA and QCEW data to estimate the PMT tax base. As a result, the estimated PMT revenue in 2020 falls by \$600+ million from \$2.77 billion to \$2.15 billion, and the distribution across counties changes.

However, the estimate is still substantially higher than actual revenue in 2020 of \$1.56 billion.

## Details of calculations

### Estimating wages excluded from the PMT

-   Wages paid by school districts and the federal government are excluded from the PMT base but are included in BEA earnings.

    -   BEA wages do not have the detail needed to estimate the federal and K12 exemptions, but an important input to BEA wages, known as QCEW wages, do have details.

    -   The QCEW is the quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It is a key input to BEA wages. It is slightly smaller than BEA wages. For example, QCEW wages in 2020 for NY County (Manhattan) were \$319.97 billion, as seen in the table below. BEA wages for NY County were \$332.8 billion, so QCEW wages were 96 percent of BEA wages. (The \$332.8 can be seen in the detailed county-level data available from *CAINC5N Personal Income by Major Component and Earnings by NAICS Industry*.)

    -   We can use QCEW wages to calculate private, state and non-K12 local wages (excluding federal wages and local K12 wages), which gives us a better estimate of the PMT taxable wage base, although it is still too high because it includes exempt small employers and possibly other exempt employers. The table below shows the resulting PMT base as a percentage of QCEW total wages. For the MTA region as a whole, this base is 94.5% of QCEW wages.

![](images/paste-15B07C79.png)

### Self-employment income

-   BEA earnings by place of work are the sum of wages, "Supplements to wages and salaries", and "Proprietors' income", as illustrated in the extract below from the BEA CAINC5N table for New York County.

![](images/paste-13471D77.png)

-   Supplements, which are included in BEA earnings, are not self-employment income at all and should be excluded. They are 12.2% of BEA earnings in New York County in 2020 (\$53.843 / \$439.599). They include employer contributions to pension plans, Social Security, and the like. While they are income to a wage worker in an economic sense, they are not self-employment income, which is what the PMT taxes.

-   Proprietors' income, in concept, is similar to self-employment income, but is vastly overstated compared to what is reported on tax returns. Table 11.3 in [BEA's documentation](https://www.bea.gov/resources/methodologies/nipa-handbook/pdf/chapter-11.pdf), copied below, shows this for 2015 for the nation as a whole. As you can see, nonfarm proprietors' income (table line 11, \$1,130.8b) is about 36% greater than the related tax return concept (table line 1, \$831.7b). Most of the difference is due to what BEA calls misreporting (underreported income for tax purposes). Under-reported income should be removed because if it is not in IRS measures of self-employment income for income tax purposes, it almost certainly is not being captured in self-employment income for payroll mobility tax purposes.
