## How large is the PMT relative to total state and local taxes in New York, and relative to the economy?

One way to gain perspective on the Payroll Mobility Tax is to compare it to total state and local revenue and to the size of the economy.

In a perfect world, we might compare the PMT to total taxes in the MTA region and to total GDP in the MTA region. Due to data limitations -- there is not a good source of data on state and local taxes in the MTA region -- below I compare the PMT to total state and local taxes and total GDP in New York. This is less than ideal and with more time it is possible to develop estimates for the MTA region.

However, the conclusion from the table below is clearly that the PMT is less than 1 % of total state and local tax revenue in New York, and less than 0.1% of state GDP.

If we were to construct estimates for the MTA region (possible with more time), the PMT almost certainly would be less than 2% of total MTA region tax revenue (including state taxes in the region), and less than 0.2% of GDP in the region.

NOTE: The Census Bureau revised state and local tax data slightly in June. Those revisions are not yet included in the numbers. They would reduce state and local taxes moderately in 2019, possibly driving the % of state and local taxes in that year up to 0.86%.

## How did the PMT affect New York's ranking for state and local taxes?

Another way to gain perspective is to examine how the PMT affected New York's tax burden ranking.

A common way of ranking state tax burdens is by comparing total taxes to the total size of the economy. The numerator is state and local taxes as measured by the U.S. Bureau of the Census and the denominator is state gross domestic product (GDP) as measured by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.

The table below shows New York's ranking, and its burden relative to the U.S. average, for years from 2016 through 2019, the year before COVID-19 affected tax revenue. It shows ranking, burden, and burden relative to the U.S. using data as reported, and recalculated as if the PMT had not been adopted.

New York's tax burden using data as reported was 3rd or 4th highest in the nation in each year, with New York's burden ranging from 28.4% to 33.7% above the U.S. average. Because the PMT is relatively small compared to New York's total taxes or to the state economy (as discussed earlier, above),
