Examine questions such as:

-   Who pays the taxes? (Commuters, others; businesses, commerical property, retail...)
-   How would tax professionals think about issues such as:
    -   Who's using the system, who's benefiting for it, and who's paying for it?
    -   Geographic breakdown - NYC vs. Long Island vs. Other MTA counties
    -   Payroll mobility tax - business on LI might be "unfairly" paying it (tax on wages of non-users of system)
    -   Progressivity and regressivity of taxes? (Note that subsidies elsewhere for transit often rely heavily on sales taxes.)
