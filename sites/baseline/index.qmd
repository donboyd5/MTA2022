# Agendas

## October 25, 2022

As much of following as practical, in priority order:

-   For hypothetical PMT increase from 0.34% to 0.50%, MCTD-wide impact and by city/suburbs, by size of employer:
    -   Crossed with work-from-home and non-work-from-home industries, and, separately,

    -   Crossed with average pay by industry
-   Ways to analyze impact of PMT on the economy
    -   Pre- and post- employment in MTA and other regions

    -   Size of PMT vs other taxes

        -   For a few representative or hypothetical firms, or for

        -   MTA region as a whole
-   For PMT increase, how would state reimbursement change? (Also, other state reimbursement issues we discussed - e.g., growth at inflation rate.)
-   Responsiveness of employment and wages, and PMT revenue, to PMT rate increase
-   Has PMT base changed much post-COVID?
-   Sales tax increase
    -   Table of current sales tax treatment - rows are NYC and MTA counties, columns are selected items (food, clothing, utilities, other), cells are treatment by state, local, and MTA sales taxes

    -   Spending by consumers in MTA region by income range on these goods and services
