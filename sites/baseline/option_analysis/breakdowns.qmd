# Tax breakdowns

## Goals

For selected possible tax increases develop breakdowns that would be helpful for (1) discussion with elected officials and (2) DOB's review.

Focus at the moment on PMT and sales tax.

## Principles of a good tax *system*

What should policymakers and DOB care about? First, they should care about traditional principles of good tax policy. (Examples: [1](https://taxfoundation.org/principles/), [2](https://www.ncsl.org/research/fiscal-policy/principles-of-a-high-quality-state-revenue-system.aspx), [3](https://itep.org/tax-principles-building-block-of-a-sound-tax-system/), [4](https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2002/feb/guidingprinciplesofgoodtaxpolicy.html).) Important commonly accepted principles:

-   **Adequacy:** stability, predictability, and sufficiency

-   **Neutrality:** neither encourage nor discourage personal or business decisions; not favor or punish specific industries, activities, and products (there can be reasons for special treatment - e.g., cigarette taxes)

-   **Equity:**

    -   *Horizontal equity:* similarly situated taxpayers should be taxed similarly -- e.g., similar incomes taxed similarly under an income tax, similar goods under a sales tax

    -   *Vertical equity:* degree of progressivity or regressivity. "Right" amount of progressivity is in the eye of the beholder. Hard to measure: *conceptual* issues (e.g., shifting; current income vs. lifetime income), *data* issues. Important to consider combined impact of multiple taxes.

-   **Simplicity:** easy to understand and comply with, easy to administer

-   **Balance:** no tax satisfies all principles; important to consider tax system as a whole.

Taxes with broad bases and low rates satisfy many of these principles.

Most tax systems violate some of these principles.

-   There are tradeoffs across principles. For example, highly progressive taxes (vertical equity) may also be highly volatile (adequacy).

-   Often, elected officials *want* to violate some principles - encourage certain kinds of activity, favor some kinds of taxpayers.

Policymakers particularly interested in data on neutrality and equity:

-   Geographic impacts - are some areas hit harder than others? (e.g., per-capita, or relative to income)

-   Businesses

    -   Are some industries hit harder than others?

    -   Small businesses vs. larger businesses?

-   Households

    -   Are lower-income households affected differently than upper-income?

    -   Married vs. other family structures?

    -   old vs. young

    -   race and ethnicity

Sometimes we can know where to put our effort based on the structure of the tax in question.

## Payroll mobility tax increase

Most likely of interest (in addition to geography):

-   Size of employer

-   Industry of employer

Structure: small business exclusion; tax rate varies by employer size for the smallest non-excluded employers.

```{r}
#| include: false

source(here::here("r", "libraries.r"))
source(here::here("r", "constants.r"))
source(here::here("r", "functions.r"))

xwalkny <- readRDS(here::here("data", "xwalks", "xwalkny.rds"))

```

### Size of employer

[Statistics of U.S. Businesses (SUSB)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/susb/about.html) data on:

-   \# firms, establishments, employment, and payroll by major industry by county,

-   by size of firm

    -   \<20 employees (probably mostly excluded from tax

    -   20-99 employees

    -   100-499 employees

    -   500+ employees

The following table gives some insight into possible impacts by employer size. Next step would be to allocate the tax by employer size, taking into consideration small-employer exclusion and lower rate.

```{r}
#| include: true
susb <- readRDS(here::here("data", "susb", "wagesize.rds"))

susb |> 
  select(-pctelt20, -fips, -stname) |> 
  mutate(across(starts_with("e"), ~ .x / total)) |> 
  arrange(desc(e500p)) |> 
  gt() |> 
  tab_header(
      title = "Wages by employer enterprise size as % of total",
      subtitle = "Source: Statistics of U.S. Businesses (SUSB), 2019"
  ) |> 
  tab_spanner(columns = starts_with("e"),
                    label="% share of total wages") |> 
  cols_label(
    county="County",
    total="Total wages ($ billions)",
    elt20="< 20",
    e2099="20-99",
    e100499="100 - <500",
    e500p="500+"
  ) |> 
  fmt_percent(columns=starts_with("e"), decimals=1) |> 
  fmt_number(columns=total, decimals=1, scale=1e-6)
  


```

```{r}
#| include: false
susb <- readRDS(here::here("data", "susb", "wagesize.rds"))
pmt1 <- readRDS(here::here("data", "pmtbase.rds"))
pmt1 |> filter(year==2020) |> pull(area)
ns(pmt1)

pmt2 <- pmt1 |>
  rename(unifips=fips) |> 
  left_join(xwalkny |> select(unifips, uniname), by="unifips") |> 
  # get only the vars we are 100% sure we might ever use for allocation
  select(unifips, uniname, year, 
         earnings_bea, wages_bea, 
         wages_pmt, nonwage_pmt, taxbase_pmt) |> 
  mutate(src="pmtbase",
         yeartype="cy") |>
  pivot_longer(cols=-c(unifips, uniname, year, yeartype, src))

```

```{r}
#| include: false
alloctotals_fn <- "090922 Subsidies for DB_djb.xlsx"


res <- readRDS(here::here("results", "allocation_results.rds"))

recipes <- read_excel(here::here("data", "mta", alloctotals_fn),
                      sheet="recipes",
                      range="A4:D23") |> 
  filter(!is.na(vname))

mtashares <- readRDS(here::here("data", "allocation", "allocators_mta.rds"))

# create a separate tibble of populations to make it easy for mta
pop <- res |> 
  select(geo_order, unifips, uniname, year, pop) |> 
  distinct() |> 
  arrange(geo_order, uniname, year) |> 
  select(-geo_order)
count(pop, unifips, uniname)

base_tabdata <- res |> 
  filter(!is.na(ftottax_summary)) |> 
  select(recipe, measure, year, geo_order, ftottax_summary, unifips, uniname,
         allocated, allocpc, ipcmta, pctofmta) |> 
  pivot_longer(c(allocated, allocpc, ipcmta, pctofmta)) |> 
  arrange(geo_order, uniname, ftottax_summary) |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = ftottax_summary)

```

### Industry of employer

BLS [Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW)](https://www.bls.gov/cew/) is main data source. Fairly straightforward, should have ready by beginning of week.

## Sales tax increase

Most likely of interest (in addition to geography):

-   Impacts by income range

Primary data source will be [Consumer Expenditure Survey](https://www.bls.gov/cex/) - regional.

-   It includes much consumption that is not subject to sales tax.

-   Need to crosswalk consumption categories to sales taxability.

-   Looking for past studies of sales tax in NYC.
