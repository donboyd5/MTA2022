I show that the long-run incidence of the tax would depend on the macroeconomic effects of the tax changes considered and illustrate the effects of alternative payroll tax changes under the same use of the revenues. Finally, because of limitations of the theoretical analysis, I relate those estimates to those provided by the recent literature on other countries and discuss how the insights from those studies can further inform the analysis of payroll tax incidence in the United States.},
