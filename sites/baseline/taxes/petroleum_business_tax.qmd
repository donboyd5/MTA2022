# Petroleum business tax

## Overview

[Tax Department](https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/petrol/ptidx.htm)

The petroleum business tax (PBT) is a privilege tax imposed on petroleum businesses operating in New York State. The PBT is imposed at a cents-per-gallon rate on petroleum products sold or used in the state. The tax imposition occurs at different points in the distribution chain depending on the type of petroleum product:

-   For motor fuel, the PBT is imposed upon importation into the state.

-   For highway diesel motor fuel, the PBT is imposed on the first sale or use in the state.

-   For non-highway diesel motor fuel and residual oil, the PBT is imposed on final sale or use.

-   For kero-jet fuel, the PBT is imposed on fuel consumed on take-off from points in the state.

The tax is jointly administered and collected with the state's [motor fuel excise tax](https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/gas/gasidx.htm).
