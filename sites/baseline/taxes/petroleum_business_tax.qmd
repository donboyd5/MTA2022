# Petroleum business tax

## Overview

[Tax Department](https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/petrol/ptidx.htm)

The petroleum business tax (PBT) is a privilege tax imposed on petroleum businesses operating in New York State.

The PBT is imposed at cents-per-gallon rates on petroleum products sold or used in the state. The rates are linked to the 12-month average producer price index for refined petroleum products, and annual increases or decreases in tax rates are limited by law to 5 percent.

There is a base tax and a supplemental tax. The base tax rates vary by product type; the supplemental tax, in general, is imposed at a uniform rate.

The base tax rates and supplemental tax rates are adjusted separately. Currently the combined tax rate for motor fuel is 17.3 cents per gallon. Full rate tables by product are further below.

Effective in 2016, all revenues collected from the PBT on aviation fuel are set aside for airport use in accordance with Federal regulations.

## Collection

The tax imposition occurs at different points in the distribution chain depending on the type of petroleum product (these choices are intended to improve enforcement and reduce evasion):

-   For motor fuel, the PBT is imposed upon **importation** into the state.

-   For highway diesel motor fuel, the PBT is imposed on the **first sale or use** in the state.

-   For non-highway diesel motor fuel and residual oil, the PBT is imposed on **final sale** or use.

-   For kero-jet fuel, the PBT is imposed on **fuel consumed on take-off from points in the state**.

The tax is jointly administered and collected with the state's [motor fuel excise tax](https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/gas/gasidx.htm).

### Rough estimate of revenue by fuel type

Using gallonage estimates from Table 9 of the [NYS Tax Department's FY 2021 collections report](https://www.tax.ny.gov/pdf/2020-2021%20collections/FY20_21%20Tables.xls), and June 2022 tax rates, it looks like motor fuel plus highway diesel fuel account for about 98% of the tax revenue. This seems consistent with what the Division of Budget says: "In terms of the share of PBT base and supplemental receipts in FY 2021, gasoline and diesel receipts based on reported gallonage constituted 84 and 15 percent of the total, respectively."

## Tax expenditures and revenue options

There are three large tax expenditures identified by the state tax department [@newyorkstatedepartmentoftaxationandfinanceFY2023Annual], shown in the table below:

-   Exemptions for liquid petroleum gas (LPG - e.g., propane)

-   Exemption for residential heating fuel - this is a political choice that runs through the sales tax as well, and would be difficult to undo

-   Exemption for sales to federal, state, and local governments - under the principle of federal sovereignty and the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution states cannot generally tax sales to the federal government; NY could choose to tax sales to the state and its local governments.

## Tax structure

### Taxpayers

The tax is paid by registered distributors.

### Tax base

*Motor fuel* is gasoline, benzol, reformulated blend stock for oxygenate blending, conventional blend stock for oxygenate blending, E85, fuel grade ethanol that meets the ASTM International active standards specification D4806 or D4814, or other product which is suitable for use in the operation of a motor vehicle engine.

*Diesel motor fuel* is No. 1 diesel fuel, No. 2 diesel fuel, biodiesel, kerosene, fuel oil, or other middle distillate, and also motor fuel suitable for operating a diesel engine. Diesel motor fuel does not include any product specifically designated "No. 4 diesel fuel" and not suitable for operating a motor vehicle engine. 

*Highway diesel motor fuel* is any diesel motor fuel that is not non-highway diesel motor fuel.

*Non-highway diesel motor fuel* is any diesel motor fuel that is designated for use other than on a public highway (except for the use of the public highway by farmers to reach adjacent farmlands), and that is *dyed diesel motor fuel*.

*Dyed diesel motor fuel* is diesel motor fuel dyed in accordance with and for the purpose of complying with the provisions of 26 USC 4082(a) and its regulations, as may be amended in the future.

### Exemptions and refunds

Exemptions:

-   sales to governments (federal, state and local);

-   kerosene, bunker fuel, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), compressed natural gas (CNG) and E-85 products;

-   sales of non-highway diesel motor fuel and residual petroleum product for residential heating use, farming, manufacturing, and mining purposes; 

-   sales of B20 and sales of non-highway diesel motor fuel for nonresidential heating (partial exemption only);

-   the use of motor fuel, diesel motor fuel, and residual petroleum product by tugboats and towboats.

**Full refunds of PBT are available for motor fuel and diesel motor fuel used in:**

-   buses providing local transit service or school transportation;

-   commercial fishing vessels; 

-   passenger commuter ferries; and 

-   tugboats and towboats.

## Tax rates

### Comparison to other states

Note: excise tax rates for states, from the Energy Information Adminstration, can be found [here](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/marketing/monthly/xls/fueltaxes.xls); this is not complete in that it does not consider sales taxes. The American Petroleum Institute does include sales taxes in [its comparisons](https://www.api.org/-/media/Files/Statistics/State-Motor-Fuel-Taxes-Charts-january-2022.pdf), and measured this way NY ranks 9th highest in the nation.

The API estimates that the combined effect of state and local taxes in early 2022 was an effective rate of 48.2 cents per gallon on gasoline, and 47 cents on diesel fuel
