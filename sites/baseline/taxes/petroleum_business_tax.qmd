# Petroleum business tax

## Overview

[Tax Department](https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/petrol/ptidx.htm)

The petroleum business tax (PBT) is a privilege tax imposed on petroleum businesses operating in New York State. The PBT is imposed at a cents-per-gallon rate on petroleum products sold or used in the state. (Currently 17.3 cents for motor fuel.)

The tax imposition occurs at different points in the distribution chain depending on the type of petroleum product (these choices are intended to improve enforcement and reduce evasion):

-   For motor fuel, the PBT is imposed upon **importation** into the state.

-   For highway diesel motor fuel, the PBT is imposed on the **first sale or use** in the state.

-   For non-highway diesel motor fuel and residual oil, the PBT is imposed on **final sale** or use.

-   For kero-jet fuel, the PBT is imposed on **fuel consumed on take-off from points in the state**.

The tax is jointly administered and collected with the state's [motor fuel excise tax](https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/gas/gasidx.htm).  

## Tax Revenue

### Rough estimate of revenue by fuel type

Using gallonage estimates from Table 9 of the [NYS Tax Department's FY 2021 collections report](https://www.tax.ny.gov/pdf/2020-2021%20collections/FY20_21%20Tables.xls), and June 2022 tax rates, it looks like motor fuel plus highway diesel fuel account for about 98% of the tax revenue. This seems consistent with what the Division of Budget says: "In terms of the share of PBT base and supplemental receipts in FY 2021, gasoline and diesel receipts based on reported gallonage constituted 84 and 15 percent of the total, respectively."

## Tax expenditures and revenue options

There are three large tax expenditures identified by the state tax department [@newyorkstatedepartmentoftaxationandfinanceFY2023Annual], shown in the table below:

-   Exemptions for liquid petroleum gas (LPG - e.g., propane)

-   Exemption for residential heating fuel - this is a political choice that runs through the sales tax as well, and would be difficult to undo

-   Exemption for sales to federal, state, and local governments - under the principle of
    federal sovereignty and the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution states cannot generally tax sales to the federal government; NY could choose to tax sales to the state and its local governments

*Diesel motor fuel* is No. 1 diesel fuel, No. 2 diesel fuel, biodiesel, kerosene, fuel oil, or other middle distillate, and also motor fuel suitable for operating a diesel engine. Diesel motor fuel does not include any product specifically designated "No. 4 diesel fuel" and not suitable for operating a motor vehicle engine. 

*Highway diesel motor fuel* is any diesel motor fuel that is not non-highway diesel motor fuel.

*Non-highway diesel motor fuel* is any diesel motor fuel that is designated for use other than on a public highway (except for the use of the public highway by farmers to reach adjacent farmlands), and that is *dyed diesel motor fuel*.

*Dyed diesel motor fuel* is diesel motor fuel dyed in accordance with and for the purpose of complying with the provisions of 26 USC 4082(a) and its regulations, as may be amended in the future.
