# Miscellaneous Taxes

## Passenger car rental tax

NYS levies a 12 percent tax (6 percent statewide special tax and 6 percent special supplemental tax) on charges for the rental or use of a passenger car with a gross vehicle weight of 9,000 pounds or less in NYS, regardless of where the vehicle is registered or the residency of the renter. For the special supplemental tax, collections from rentals in the MCTD are directed to the MTA (off-Budget) and collections from rentals outside the MCTD are directed to PTSOA. The tax does not apply to a car lease covering a period of one year or more. governorkathyhochulNewYorkState
