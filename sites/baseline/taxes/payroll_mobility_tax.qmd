[Payroll expense](https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/mctmt/def_ps.htm#pe) generally means a [covered employee's](https://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/mctmt/def_ce.htm#coveredemp "covered employee's") wages and compensation that are subject to either social security or railroad retirement tax, but with no annual cap applied.

### Self-employment tax

Net earnings from self-employment allocated to the MCTD means your net earnings from self-employment that are attributable to a business carried on within the MCTD. \[As with wages, this is a place of work concept.\]

\[Note: This differs from the BEA definition of non-farm proprietors' income, which is discussed in their documentation [here](https://www.bea.gov/resources/methodologies/nipa-handbook/pdf/chapter-11.pdf).\]
