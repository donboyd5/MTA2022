I (Boyd) will put questions for the MTA here as they arise.

## Questions relating to revenue and finances

-   I would like to be sure I am focusing on the right revenue sources. I have copied below p.II-8 (electronic page 21) from Volume 1 of the July Financial Plan update. [@metropolitantransportationauthorityMTA2023Preliminary2022a]

    -   Are the tax elements of this the right sources to focus on? (I will prioritize, likely by size.)

    -   Is there any tax item on the table that should be excluded from a baseline analysis?

    -   Are there any tax items not in the table that should be included in a baseline analysis?

-   Does MTA have an online source for collections history of MTA taxes, ideally monthly, in spreadsheet form, or other computer friendly form? I have not found one yet. (I am not talking about ACFR/CAFR and AIS documents, which I have access to. I am interested in spreadsheets or other computerized forms such as csv files or database files.)

-   Kevin said something like, "Bridges and tunnels, net of operating and debt service, contribute \$1.2 billion toward \[MTA transit?\]". Where can I find that calculation?

-   Does MTA have a copy of the 2012 Rockland County "study" about secession from the MTA? It would be nice (but not essential) to read. I haven't found it yet. Here's a Politico [article](https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2012/03/rockland-county-proposes-to-secede-from-the-mta-and-a-former-mayor-rolls-his-eyes-002715) about it.

## Questions relating to ridership

While examining ridership it is not part of the project, I would like to understand the basics of the MTA's ridership analysis:

-   Can MTA provide a copy of a technical report prepared by McKinsey that underlies [@metropolitantransportationauthorityMcKinseyRidershipRevenue2022]? (I have [@metropolitantransportationauthorityMcKinseyAnalysisMetropolitan2020].)

-   Why did ridership plunge around Feb 2022 and fall off the prior recovery path? Was there some sort of glitch in the data or in transit at that point? See graph below from [@metropolitantransportationauthorityJuly2022Financial2022].
