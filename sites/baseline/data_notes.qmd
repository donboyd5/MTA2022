## Data about MTA finances and ridership

### Finance data

-   Does MTA have an online source for collections history of MTA taxes, ideally monthly, in spreadsheet form, or other computer friendly form? I have not found one yet. (I am not talking about ACFR/CAFR and AIS documents, which I have access to. I am interested in spreadsheets or other computerized forms such as csv files or database files.)

### Other data

-   [MTA Performance Dashboard](https://new.mta.info/transparency/metrics)
-   [MTA Surveys from 2018](https://new.mta.info/transparency/surveys)
-   Static and API [data for developers](http://web.mta.info/developers/developer-data-terms.html#data)
-   Open data portals
    -   [MTA Open Data Program](https://new.mta.info/open-data); listing of [MTA's OpenData files](https://new.mta.info/document/85371)

    -   [NYC OpenData for MTA](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/MTA-Data/mmu8-8w8b) - link at the site does not work; [this](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?q=mta&sortBy=relevance) shows some related data but none looks especially relevant

    -   [Data.Gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/mta-data) data link for MTA - also does not work

    -   [data.ny.gov MTA data](https://data.ny.gov/browse?q=mta&sortBy=relevance) -- NYS open data site

        -   [MTA Daily Ridership Data: Beginning 2020](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Daily-Ridership-Data-Beginning-2020/vxuj-8kew)
        -   [Monthly ridership 2008+](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/Metropolitan-Transportation-Authority-MTA-Monthly-/qqdg-h2tq) (not as current as the daily data)
-   OSC has a site for tracking subway [turnstile data](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/reports/osdc/impact-covid-19-pandemic-subway-ridership-new-york-city). They posted an Excel [data file](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/files/reports/osdc/excel/nyc-subway-usage-data-level-june-2022.xlsx) with monthly stats from June 2020 - June 2022.
-   Add NYS tax data files from open data portal, which will include MTA taxes
-   [NYC Independent Budget Office (IBO) Tax Revenue FY 1980 - FY 2020](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Independent-Budget-Office-IBO-Tax-Revenue-FY-1/hdnu-nbrh) - will soon be updated, and I can get more-current data directly from IBO.
