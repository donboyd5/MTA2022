# Mass Transportation Operating Assistance Fund (MTOAF)

## Goals

-   MTOA model (initially, state taxes, then examine NYC taxes Urban, MRT)

    -   Process from collection by Tax Dept to deposit in MTOA

        -   Law
        -   Reports and other documents and information sources
        -   Actual data in past years
            -   to what extent can we reconcile?
            -   e.g., to what extent are taxes appropriated different from taxes collected in a given year

    -   Model of the process

        -   Can we create a model of this process?
        -   Goal is NOT to forecast annual taxes, but rather...
        -   Given a forecast of annual taxes
            -   When should the money be collected during the year?
            -   When should the money be deposited during the year?
            -   Perhaps incorporate DOB cash flow forecast (if available); if not develop a history driven cash-flow forecast
            -   Can we know if collections and deposits are different from what we'd expect - is the revenue on target, and if not, by how much is it off?
        -   Can we do this with a spreadsheet model - for example, have it go out to the web, ge the latest data, and do the calculations?
        -   Relatedly, when Executive Budget comes out, have a way to infer (a) the annual deposits to MTOA, and (b) the monthly cash flows

## Key documents

-   I've created an [MTOA Google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gi0RZbja6sTNWMfZC6wygXTILaoowtDZ?usp=sharing), with separate subfolders by agency. It has many of the documents listed below so that they are all in one place.

-   The DOB documents will be what we need on budget day.

### Office of the State Comptroller (OSC)

-   [Fund Classification Manual](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/files/state-agencies/pdf/fund-classification-manual.pdf)

    -   Gives statutory authority, purpose, list of receipt sources and expenditure uses, fund and account numbers in OSC accounting system, and more

    -   See [OSC Fund classification manual], below

-   [Comptroller's Annual Report to the Legislature on State Funds Cash Basis of Accounting](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/reports/finance) - Excel files and pdfs, multiple years, with state fiscal year actual receipts.

[osc](https://www.osc.state.ny.us/files/reports/finance/cash-basis/pdf/cash-basis-annual-2022.pdf)

    -   *Exhibit A-2 - Combining Statement of Cash Receipts, Disbursements and changes in Fund Balances, for Special Revenue Funds - State*:

        -   Gives a high-level full financial view of individual State SRFs on an annual basis -- opening balance, receipts by major category, transfers in, disbursements by major category, transfers out, and closing balance.

        -   MTOAF is a state SRF and is shown. (Individual MTOAF accounts are not given.)

        -   See [OSC Annual MTOAF flows from Exhibit A-2] of high-level MTOAF flows below, constructed from annual A-2 tables.

    -   *Schedule 4 Governmental Funds Combining Schedule of Tax Receipts* - Gives more detail on tax receipts for individual funds, including MTOAF (but not individual accounts).

        -   See [OSC Detailed receipts per Schedule 4 and Exhibit A-2] for example Schedule 4, and table of details for most-recent 4 years.

### DOB

-   History through budget year are in the [Economic & Revenue Outlook](#economic-revenue-outlook). Selected outyear projections are in the [Five-Year Financial Plan].

-   I have not found a budget document that gives tax-by-tax MTOA estimates. I think we will have to estimate them from the all-funds estimates for taxes.

#### Economic & Revenue Outlook {#economic-revenue-outlook}

-   The Economic & Revenue Outlook released with the executive budget is a critical document. The 2023-24 version will be out by February 1. We should be able to construct full MTOAF estimates from that.

-   Here are links to the [2022-23](https://www.budget.ny.gov/pubs/archive/fy23/ex/ero/fy23ero.pdf) and 2023-24 \[to come\] versions.

-   DOB gives historical estimates and a budget-year forecast of MTOAF tax revenue for individual taxes, some of which is estimated at the account level. DOB does not appear to give all MTOAF receipts numbers, but rather just tax receipts.

-   I have not found a budget document that

-   With minor exceptions historical tax numbers match OSC numbers.

-   See below for an example table, and a historical table I constructed from DOB tables that also shows the difference vs. OSC in total taxes.

#### Five-Year Financial Plan

-   Has receipts and disbursements projections for the year that is ending, plus 5 more years. It also has some projections on a fund basis and a program basis (transportation). Thus, the 2023-24 budget will have FY 2022-23 through 2027-28.

-   In the 2022-23 budget, there were two versions, the plan [released on the day of the budget](https://www.budget.ny.gov/pubs/archive/fy23/ex/fp/fy23fp-ex.pdf), and the [version released with the 30-day amendments](https://www.budget.ny.gov/pubs/archive/fy23/ex/fp/fy23fp-ex-amend.pdf). As far as I can tell, the two plans were the same for MTOA

## Comparison to MTA MMTOA estimates

It seems like we should be able to reconcile the State Comptroller's disbursements or total outflows from MTOAF with what the MTA shows as total receipts from MTOAF. For that, I probably need to use monthly data from the Comptroller and put them on an approximately calendar year. I'll do that next, but it would be good to talk about the right MTA numbers to compare to, and whether we can match specific payments out of MTOAF to specific receipts of the MTA.

Below, FWIW,

![](images/image-2141389204.png)

Here is the MTA's MMTOA state fiscal year table from the current continuing disclosure statement.

![](images/image-131623474.png)

It is good to see that the tax receipts numbers match the OSC table above, repeated below. However, I don't yet see how to match the disbursements out of MTOAF. I must need to figure what goes out of MTOAF that does not go to MTA?

## Tax receipts per DOB

DOB gives historical estimates in the annual economic revenue outlook. Here's a sample historical table from the [2022-23 Executive Budget Economic & Revenue Outlook](https://www.budget.ny.gov/pubs/archive/fy23/ex/ero/fy23ero.pdf).

![](images/image-1285919789.png)

And here's a sample forecast table:

![](images/image-461620804.png)

Finally, here is a historical table constructed from the individual tax table. It also shows the comparison to OSC tax numbers; the difference is in the bank tax. I repeat the OSC table immediately below to make the comparison easier.

accounts established by and pursuant to sections W46-2.0 and II46-4.0 of\
the administrative code of the city of New York, such commissioner of\
finance shall, within twelve days of such certification, pay over such\

transportation systems in the metropolitan transportation commuter\
district in order to meet the operating expenses of such systems,\
provided, however, with respect to the metropolitan transportation\
authority, its affiliates and subsidiaries, and notwithstanding any\
general or special law to the contrary, other than such a law which\
makes specific reference to this section, and subject to the provisions\
of section twelve hundred seventy-c of the public authorities law, so\
long as the metropolitan transportation authority dedicated tax fund\
established by section twelve hundred seventy-c of the public\
authorities law shall exist, any such appropriation to the metropolitan\
transportation authority, its affiliates or its subsidiaries shall be\
deemed to be an appropriation to the metropolitan transportation\
authority and the total amount paid pursuant to such appropriation or\
appropriations shall be deposited to such metropolitan transportation\
authority dedicated tax fund and distributed in accordance with the\
provisions of section twelve hundred seventy-c of the public authorities\
law. Nothing contained in this subdivision shall be deemed to restrict\
the right of the state to amend, repeal, modify or otherwise alter\
statutes imposing or relating to the taxes producing revenues for\
deposit in the metropolitan mass transportation operating assistance\
account or the appropriations relating thereto. The metropolitan\
transportation authority shall not include within any resolution,\
contract or agreement with holders of the bonds or notes issued under\

provision which provides that a default occurs as a result of the state\
exercising its right to amend, repeal, modify or otherwise alter such\
taxes or appropriations.\

9. Any moneys in the mass transportation operating assistance fund and\
in any of the accounts in such fund may, at the discretion of the state\
comptroller, be invested in securities and obligations as defined by\
section ninety-eight-a of this chapter. Any income earned by the\
investment of moneys in any of the accounts in such fund shall be added\
to and become a part of, and shall be used for the purposes of such\
account.
